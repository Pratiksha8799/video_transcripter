# YouTube Transcript Fetcher ðŸŽ¥

The YouTube Transcript Fetcher is a Python script designed to automate the retrieval of transcripts from YouTube videos. The script utilizes the YouTubeTranscriptApi library for fetching video transcripts and Selenium WebDriver for interacting with YouTube's search functionality.

## Features
- Automated Transcript Retrieval: Fetches transcripts of YouTube videos by providing the video ID.

- Search and Fetch: Automatically searches for videos on YouTube based on a provided query and retrieves transcripts from the top search results.

- Selenium WebDriver Integration: Interacts with YouTube to perform search queries and extract video links.

- Simple Output: Combines the transcript into a single text string and prints it to the console.

- Multilanguage: The script supports to multiple laguages. 

## Prerequisites
1. Python Environment
Python Version: Ensure that Python 3.x or higher is installed on your system. The project is compatible with Python 3 and uses modern libraries and features.

2. Required libraries.
You need to install specific Python libraries for interacting with browser and fetch transcript of video. Install these libraries using pip:

* youtube_transcript_api: A library for text-to-speech conversion.
* selenium: A library for reading and extracting text from PDF files.


## How It Works
* Initialization: The user provides a search query.

* YouTube Interaction: The script searches YouTube for the query and extracts the video link.

* Extracting Video ID: The video ID is extracted from the URL.

* Extracting language code: Identify which language the transcript is in and return code.

* Fetching Transcripts: The transcript for the video is fetched using the YouTubeTranscriptApi.

* Output: The transcript is saved into txt file.
## Used By

- Content Creators: Content creators who want to extract transcripts of their own or othersâ€™ videos for editing or repurposing content.

- Researchers and Analysts: Individuals who need to analyze the content of videos in bulk for research purposes.

- Language Learners: Learners who wish to read and analyze video content for language learning or transcription practice.

- Developers: Developers looking to integrate transcript retrieval into their own applications or tools.
## Future scope

* User Interface: Develop a simple GUI to allow non-technical users to input search queries and view transcripts easily.

* Data Storage: Implement a feature to save transcripts to any other file (e.g. JSON) for future reference.


## Limitations

* Transcript Availability: The tool can only fetch transcripts for videos that have them enabled. Some videos may not have transcripts available.

* Performance: The tool's performance may be affected by the speed of the WebDriver interactions and network conditions.

##  Conclusion ðŸš€

YouTubeÂ TranscriptÂ FetcherÂ automatesÂ theÂ retrievalÂ ofÂ videoÂ transcriptsÂ fromÂ YouTubeÂ inÂ anyÂ language. While it has some limitations, such as dependency on Selenium and the availability of transcripts, it serves as a strong foundation for further development and customization to meet various user needs.
