this is valmiki ramayan season 6 episode
1. crossing the ocean
previously we saw how the vanaras had
come up to the southern Seashore as they
searched for Sita
after many days of a futile search they
had finally found out that ravan had
taken Sita to Lanka
but how to go across the hundred yojanas
of sea to get to Lanka
no one could do this
no one was even willing to try
except
Hanuman
attempting The Impossible he left off
towards Lanka
and thus Begins the fifth book of The
Ram iron the sunderkand
left off
did Hanuman swim across the ocean or did
he go flying
anuman's epic journey is described in
the first sarga of the sunderkand the
longest sarga of the entire ramayan
and the words are clear
Hanuman swam to Lanka
but while Mickey's poetic Brilliance is
such that the image left in our mind is
of Hanuman flying through the sky
at the end of kishkindhakand itself
Hanuman had said
I will push back the sea Waters with my
arms
I will strike the ocean with my legs
tells us more about hanuman's swimming
technique
it was akin to what we call the
butterfly stroke
Hanuman would throw both his arms out in
the air together
it seemed like a pair of five-headed
snakes had emerged
put his head into the water and then
come out looking upwards his mouth
opened
[Music]
foreign
it appeared as if the great Warner
wanted to drink the entire ocean
and then he looked to the sky as though
he was still thirsty
his large eyes christened brightly
he wrote The Mighty ocean waves on his
chest
Nan
he went past them one by one so quickly
as if he were counting them
and as he struck the sea with his legs
he left behind a wake of Ripples and
foam
but around his practical description of
how Hanuman swam
valmiki spins a web of Fantastical
imagery
remember
is that which has happened in the past
and is told in story format
told with poetic Embellishments
while Mickey politically sees the sea as
if it were the sky
he says Hanuman leapt off towards Lanka
with such speed
that it caused a gale
many flowers fell into the sea because
of this wind
ham
the sea then looked like the Starry Sky
[Music]
and so while Hanuman was going in and
out of water
while Mickey says Hanuman was like the
Moon
again and again going behind clouds and
then re-emerging
[Music]
this journey was a grueling test of
endurance
luckily on the way anuman could rest for
a bit on the sandbank that had emerged
from the sea during low tide
but soon after that stop he faced two
life-threatening challenges
he got pulled into a deadly whirlpool
and an enormous salt water crocodile
attacked him
while narrating these events Paul Miki
has given Wings to Hanuman and to his
own poetic imagination
anuman was cruising through the sky
his huge body looked like a mountain
flying without any support
the ocean then thought
I must find a way to give Hanuman some
rest
he is doing this incredible feat for the
ixwaku dynasty
and I owe them
I had expanded my boundaries during the
time of Ram's forefathers
note a reference to rising sea levels in
an earlier era
and so the ocean said to mount mynak
that lay hidden under the water
o Noble Mountain
you have the ability to grow
upwards and sideways
I urge you to rise from the sea now
during that order maynath then pierced
through the surface of the ocean and
rose up
speaks Shining brilliantly
anuman thought that this was some
obstacle in his way and he struck the
mountain with his chest
a mountain then assumed a human form
and said to him
you have come a long way
you are my honored guest
please rest for a while
replied
thank you for your hospitality but I
cannot stay for long I must hurry
and then the mighty Warner touched the
mountain with his hands and ascended
once again to the sky with a smile on
his face
essentially a sand bank oshul had
emerged from the ocean during low tide
Hanuman came ashore got his breath and
was again on his way
but soon after this
Hanuman was challenged by surasa the
Great Serpent
she assumed a terrifying form encircled
Hanuman
and said to him
I shall eat you up
explained to her why he was going to
Lanka she ought not to obstruct him
but surasa said
there is no other way
o great wanna you will have to go
through my mouth
such is the Boon that I have got from
Brahma
and then she opened her gigantic mouth
and stood in front of him
her mouth was a massive 10 yojana's wife
[Music]
but Hanuman was not intimidated
he also grew himself to an equal size
then opened her mouth to 20 yojanas
in response an enraged Hanuman grew to
become 30 yojana's doll
and thus they both became bigger and
bigger
finally when sorasa opened her mouth to
hundred yojanas
Hanuman suddenly shrunk his body to the
size of a thumb
[Music]
mouth and got out again
he said to her I have been inside your
mouth as per your boon
now you must let me pass
suresaw was pleased and let him go
in simple words anuman was caught in a
deadly whirlpool in the middle of the
sea
he made several attempts to swim out of
it
but the currents kept pulling him back
there was no getting away
eventually he quickly went straight into
the eye of the vortex
and came out successfully on the other
side
[Music]
while Mickey's reference to Hanuman
growing and reducing his size should not
be taken literally
expanding in size symbolizes growing
determination exerting more power
trying harder
Contracting in size stands for showing
agility and nimbleness
think about it if Hanuman could actually
grow 200 yojanas
what was the need for him to swim or fly
he could have simply stepped across the
sea to reach Lanka
Hanuman was once again cruising along
towards Lanka
suddenly he was stopped in his tracks
someone had caught his shadow
and he was unable to move forward
Hanuman looked all around and up and
down
a huge being arose from the sea
it was the rakshasi simhika
sugriv had warned him about her
as he had done with surasa anuman
expanded himself to an enormous size
opened her mouth wide and came for him
anuman then quickly contracted himself
entered the rakshasi's mouth
struck her white organs from inside and
got out before she could close her mouth
[Music]
hanuman's strike was Lethal
the attacker's lifeless body crashed
into the sea
[Music]
in other words
a sea crocodile grabbed Hanuman From
Below
and he managed to free himself from its
grip it attacked a second time from the
front
Hanuman landed a lightning fast blow
inside its wide open mouth and killed
the fierce creature
by the way the saltwater crocodile is
found even today near India's east coast
and across Southeast Asia
this Beast is 10 to 20 feet in length
that is up to 3 meters long
attacks by Ambush and often swallows its
prey hole
it is the apex predator
at the top of the food chain
no wonder while Mickey has called her a
simhika lioness
[Music]
and shortly after that Hanuman reached
the shores of Lanka
he had achieved the impossible
indeed he was the son of the Lord of
wind
Unstoppable
what a feat what a story
[Music]
huh awesome
that is how it happened
